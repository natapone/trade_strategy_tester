# Trade strategy tester ttest
Use t test to determine strategy profit by comparing with zero return

Ref: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/t-test.asp

A t-test is an inferential statistic used to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two groups and how they are related. In this case, returns from strategy should be significantly difference from random returns (assume mean = 0).

- T-score or t-value: is distance from mean
- P-value: indicate confident level to reject null hypothesis (lower than limit => significantly different)
